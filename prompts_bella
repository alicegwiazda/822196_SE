You are an expert in art history and painting attribution.

TASK:
Given the image, perform the following analysis:

A) ARTIST IDENTIFICATION
•⁠  ⁠State the most likely artist and explain why.
•⁠  ⁠If the author cannot be confidently determined, list 2–3 plausible candidates and justify.

B) ERA & STYLE
•⁠  ⁠Name the artistic period (e.g., High Renaissance, Romanticism, Cubism).
•⁠  ⁠Describe visual cues that support your conclusion (color palette, brushwork, subject, composition).

C) SHORT HISTORICAL CONTEXT (max 150 words)
•⁠  ⁠Summarize the historical background of the artwork or the movement.
•⁠  ⁠Include any relevant cultural or societal influences.

RULES:
•⁠  ⁠If information is uncertain, say "not enough evidence" instead of guessing.
•⁠  ⁠Do not invent titles, dates, or facts without justification
